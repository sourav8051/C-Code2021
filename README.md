# C++-Code2021
1. Implement the construction of a class named DAS. The design should support  the following features.  
   a) The class should have a private container that can be a data structure of your  choice. It is recommended that you use C-style arrays.  
   b)  The class should support templates. We should be able to work with both  float and int data types for example.  
   c) The class should have the flexibility to allocate fixed size or variable size  depending on the choice of the user.  
   d)  The class should have the following methods :- 
        push() -- append an element to the existing container from the front 
        pop() --  remove the element from the front of the container   
        front() – return a pointer to the element at the front of the container   
        back() – return a pointer to the element at the back of the container  
   e) The class should be iterable. You can choose to design the iterator according  to your choice.  
   f) We should be able to destroy the class with grace. 
   g) You can add many more design features according to your wish.
